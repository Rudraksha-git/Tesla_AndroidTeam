# Simple Flutter Authentication App

This project provides a basic implementation of a user signup and login flow using Flutter. It's designed to be a starting point for integrating authentication into your mobile applications.

## Description

This application demonstrates how to create a simple user interface for registration and login. It includes input fields for email and password, basic form validation, and navigation between the signup and login screens. While this README focuses on the UI and client-side logic, it lays the groundwork for connecting to a backend authentication service.

## Features

* **User Registration:** Allows new users to create an account with an email and password.

* **User Login:** Enables existing users to sign in with their credentials.

* **Basic Form Validation:** Includes client-side validation for email format and password strength (e.g., minimum length).

* **Navigation:** Seamless transition between signup and login screens.

* **Responsive UI:** Designed to adapt to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

* **Flutter:** UI Toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

* **Dart:** Programming language used by Flutter.

* **Firebase:** (Potentially for backend authentication, database, etc.)

## Usage

* **Signup Screen:**

    * Enter a valid email address.

    * Enter a password (e.g., at least 6 characters).

    * Tap the "Sign Up" button to attempt registration.

* **Login Screen:**

    * Enter your registered email address.

    * Enter your password.

    * Tap the "Login" button to attempt login.

* **Switching Screens:** Use the "Already have an account? Login" or "Don't have an account? Sign Up" links to navigate between the two screens.
